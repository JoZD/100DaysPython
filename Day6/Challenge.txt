This is the solution I've made :) 

def turnRight():
    #Since the back position
    for i in range(0,3):
        turn_left()
        
        
def skipWall():
    #At the end, the robot will be facing the right
    turn_left()
    move()
    turnRight()
    move()
    turnRight()
    move()
    turn_left()

while not at_goal():
    if wall_in_front():
        skipWall()
    else:
        move()
