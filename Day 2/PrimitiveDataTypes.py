# Primitive Data Types


# Strings are used to store characters 

x ="My String"

# integers are used to store numbers 

y = 10

#When working with large integers, we can separate numbers using the _ 

a = 100_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000 #This makes the code easier to read 

#Float values are used to store decimal numbers

z = 3.15  #With python is not needed to declare the data type


# Booleans are values that store True or False

flag = False
